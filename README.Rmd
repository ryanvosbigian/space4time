The goal of space4time is to provide a user-friendly interface for fitting a age-specific time-stratified space-for-time mark-recapture model. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of space4time like so:

``` {r eval = FALSE} 
remotes::install_github("ryanvosbigian/space4time")
```

## Example


```{r example}
library(space4time)
## basic example code

set.seed(1)

# simulate data required to make capture history
sim.dat <- sim_simple_s4t_ch(N = 800)

# to make the capture history, need data in a specific format.

# the observations of individuals need to be in a data.frame, with
# the columns "id", "site", "time", and "removed" (no other columns are used)
head(sim.dat$s4t_ch$obs_data$ch_df)

# id is the individual ID. Converted to a character type.
# site is the name of the site the individual was observed at
# time is the time stratum (i.e. year). Can be a Date format or integer.
# removed is a logical (TRUE or FALSE) that indicates where the individual
#         was removed at that site (i.e. capture but not released)

# the data on the age of the individuals 
head(sim.dat$s4t_ch$obs_data$all_aux)
# the required columns are "id", "obs_time", and "ageclass"
# id is the individual id. Note that all individuals must be included
# obs_time is the time when the age of the individuals was observed. Or,
#           if the time when the individual was first observed.
# ageclass is the age of the individual. If age is unknown, NA is used.
# Other columns can be used in the ageclass submodel or for 
#           individual based covariates. NAs are not allowed.

# Also need to make the s4t_config object, which describes the sites arrangement,
# and the ages that individuals can be.

# Fitting the model.
# p_formula = ~ t : detection probability varies by time (note that
#                   detection probabilities are not used for transitions from
#                   the first site or to the last site. 
#                   Because there are only 3 sites, the only site where
#                   detection probs are estimated are for site 2. 
#                   If there were additional sites, then we would use ~t*k)

# theta_formula = ~ a1 * a2 * s * j : fitting the fully saturated transition
#                                     probabilities. This allows for separate
#                                     probabilities for each age, duration of
#                                     holdover (i.e. age that individuals
#                                     transition to the next site), time, 
#                                     and site.

# fixed_age = TRUE : The age-class submodel is fit separately, and the outputs
#                     are used in the mark-recapture model. The model runs
#                     faster when this is done.
